# Agent instructions

Before editing this plugin, read `skills/creating-plugins/SKILL.md` completely. Codex discovers the same directory through `.agents/skills`; Claude discovers it through `.claude/skills` and reads these instructions through `.claude/CLAUDE.md`.
Keep `emdash-plugin.jsonc` aligned with the runtime implementation, declare every capability and host the plugin uses, and run the generated validation, typecheck, test, and build scripts after changes.
For branches, version bumps, and registry publish, follow `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Never add AI co-author trailers. Never use em-dashes.
